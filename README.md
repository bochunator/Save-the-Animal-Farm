# Save the Animal Farm

My main purpose was to make a simple game.

I have based on Sandip Bhattacharya video, here is link:

I changed view to surfaceview to separate frames drawing from logic to two threads. I added more available pets, colorfull planets instead of spikes, new grounds, backgrounds. Character de facto teleporting to place where you tap instead moving with specific velocity.

Finally I uploaded on google play, so you can simple download:
