## About project

My main purpose was to learn android environment, because I wanted to show my programming skills to people who would ask about my interests.

## Why java?

I've chosen Java because it was easier to learn when I had done some C++ programs.

I heard about java when I was a kid, so it also had an impact on my decision. Java is used not only in mobile applications, so I've chosen java.

## What have I learned?

- How game loops work, I've found they are similar to PLC controllers and microcontrollers as arduino.
- Activities-lifecycle concept in android.
- SurfaceView which purpose is to provide a surface in which a secondary thread can render into the screen.
- Why Garbage collector should not be used in game loop.
- Understood the game publishing process on the Google Play Store, including requirements for icons, descriptions, promotional graphics, etc.

## What I would change, if I had to do new game

- Use vulkan for rendering, due to its multithreading advantages.
- Change programming language to C++.
